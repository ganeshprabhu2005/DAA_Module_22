## AIM:
To find the minimum number of operations to convert str1 to str2 using Naive recursive method.

## Algorithm

1. Read two strings `str1` and `str2` from user input.
2. Define a recursive function `LD(s, t, m, n)` to compute edit distance between strings `s` and `t`.
3. Base case: if `m == 0`, return `n` since `s` is empty and needs `n` insertions.
4. Base case: if `n == 0`, return `m` since `t` is empty and needs `m` deletions.
5. If characters `s[m-1]` and `t[n-1]` are equal, return `LD(s, t, m-1, n-1)` with no operation needed.
6. If characters are different, consider all three operations:
7. Compute cost of deletion as `LD(s, t, m-1, n)`.
8. Compute cost of insertion as `LD(s, t, m, n-1)`.
9. Compute cost of substitution as `LD(s, t, m-1, n-1)`.
10. Return `1 + min(deletion, insertion, substitution)` as the minimum edit distance.

    else:
        return 1+min(LD(s, t,m-1,n),LD(s, t,m,n-1),LD(s, t,m-1,n-1))

str2=input()

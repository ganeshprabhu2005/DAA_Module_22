## AIM:
To find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings..

## Algorithm

1. Read two strings X and Y from user input.
2. Compute lengths m and n of X and Y respectively.
3. Create a 2D list dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) initialized with zeros.
4. Initialize variables ma = 0 and end = 0 to track the maximum length and ending index of the common substring.
5. Loop over i from 1 to m.
6. Inside that, loop over j from 1 to n.
7. If X\[i-1] equals Y\[j-1], set dp\[i]\[j] = 1 + dp\[i-1]\[j-1].
8. If the new dp\[i]\[j] is greater than ma, update ma to dp\[i]\[j] and end to i.
9. After both loops, the longest common substring ends at index `end` in X and has length `ma`.
10. Return the substring X\[end - ma : end] as the longest common substring.

                dp[i][j]=1+dp[i-1][j-1]
                if dp[i][j]>ma:
                    ma=dp[i][j]
                    end=i
    return X[end-ma:end]
